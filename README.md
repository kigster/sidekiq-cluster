## Sidekiq Cluster

This is a tiny gem that allows starting sidekiq using multiple processes. It is originally based on the wonderful [Honebadger Cluster Script](http://blog.honeybadger.io/introducing-our-sidekiq-cluster-script/). 

Features:

 * It does not depend on any particular version of sidekiq, as long as the CLI class of Sidekiq remains named the same.

 * It does not attempt to replicate Sidekiq's command line options. Script itself can be controlled with its own CLI options preceeding the double dash `--`. Options to Sidekiq are expected after the double dash.
 
 * You can specify **max number of processes** and **max total RAM used by this cluster** (expressed as a percentage of total). If one of the Sidekiq processes exceeeds it, it is automatically restarted. 

### Usage

The easiest way to use Sidekiq Cluster is to add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq-cluster', require: false
```

Run `bundle`, and then start Sidekiq cluster like so (this starts exactly two Sidekiq Processes):

```bash
# this starts sidekiq with default options
$ bundle exec sidekiq-cluster -N 2

# this starts sidekiq with custom options
$ bundle exec sidekiq-cluster -N 2 -- -r $(pwd) -q default,10 -q high,100
```

### Command Line Options


Then try running it with `--help`:

```
sidekiq-cluster -h

USAGE
     sidekiq-cluster [options] -- [sidekiq-options]

EXAMPLES
    $ cd rails_app
    $ bundle exec sidekiq-cluster -N 2 -- -c 10 -q default,12 -L log/sidekiq.log

    --pidfile /var/pids/sidekiq.pid \  
    --name default \
    --max-memory 90 \
    --logfile /var/log/sidekiq-cluster.log \

## Contributing to sidekiq-cluster
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
